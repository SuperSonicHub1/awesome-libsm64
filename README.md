A collection of things made with libsm64.

## *Super Mario 64* Decompilation Project

https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/

> A Super Mario 64 decompilation, brought to you by a bunch of clever folks.
> This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), (E), and (SH).

## libsm64

https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64

> The purpose of this project is to provide a clean interface to the movement and rendering
> code which was reversed from SM64 by the SM64 decompilation project,
> so that Mario can be dropped in to existing game engines or other systems with minimal effort.
> This project produces a shared library file containing mostly code from the decompilation project,
> and loads an official SM64 ROM at runtime to get Mario's texture and animation data, so any project
> which makes use of this library must ask the user to provide a ROM for asset extraction.

## Bindings and Integrations

### Rust

https://github.com/nickmass/libsm64-rust

> This is a thin layer of rust bindings over the very excellent libsm64 project.

* [Documentation](https://nickmass.com/doc/libsm64/index.html)

### C#

https://github.com/MeltyPlayer/libsm64-sharp

> C# bindings for libsm64.
> 
> This library provides both:
> - A high-level C# object-oriented layer for safely calling the libsm64 methods.
> - A low-level interop layer for calling libsm64-ext's methods directly.

### Blender

https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64-blender

> This add-on integrates libsm64 into Blender and provides various additional integrations with [Fast64](https://bitbucket.org/kurethedead/fast64/).
> Practically, this means if you're making levels with Fast64 in Blender, you can use this add-on to drop a controller-playable Mario into your scene to run around and test your terrain layout.

## Postscript

Feel free to make a PR or issue if you have something to add
here. Shoutout to [Saltydkdan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YwjSUdx0wg) for introducing me to libsm64; I still have no idea
how this illuded me for over a year and got on the front page
of Hacker News without me noticing.
